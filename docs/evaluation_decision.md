# `Sample Project` - Decision Log
This protocol summarises the decisions from the evaluation of the data mining phase, which are made, for example, in a workshop together with the client and other stakeholders.

Any presentation material created for such a workshop should also be stored in the `docs` folder.

It is important to list who was involved in the decisions and when they were made.

The structure and level of detail of this protocol should be tailored to the customs of the relevant organisation and the requirements of the decision-makers.
